# Super Mario VR

A [THREE.js][three]-based VR game inspired to Super Mario World!

This project relies heavily on the [WebVR Polyfill][polyfill] to provide VR
support if the [WebVR API][spec] is not implemented. It also uses the [WebVR
UI][ui] project to render the UI to enter VR and magic window modes.
